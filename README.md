# Atos Bootcamp repository

### Spring framework bootcamp

This repository contains the exercices from the course on (Spring)[https://spring.io/] imparted by (Atos)[https://atos.net/es/spain] Spain members.

Spring is a framework for developing web-based applications (full-stack development) on Java. This amazing tool help us to build clean, scalable and production-ready code.

I thank all the Atos team for this great opportunity!
